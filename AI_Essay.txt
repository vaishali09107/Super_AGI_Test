Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. However, it also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as job displacement due to automation and issues related to privacy and security.
